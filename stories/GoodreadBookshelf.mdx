# react-goodreads-shelf

This React component allows you to display a public Goodreads shelf in a React application. It's a lot like the Goodreads JavaScript widget, but allows for more customization, better async loading, and React-like usage.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={GoodreadsBookshelfStories.MinimalShelf} />
</Canvas>
