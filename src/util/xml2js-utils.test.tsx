Hundreds of thousands of fans tune in weekly to their podcast and television broadcast to get their analysis of the previous week's matches and soccer news. But for all their passion, many American fans are new to the sport: they weren't following it (or weren't yet born) when, for example, Maradona scored two of the most remarkable World Cup goals of all time in 1986, or when George Best was leading Manchester United to glory on the pitch and boozing and rampaging off of it. Now, Rog and Davo fill in all the gaps with this hugely entertaining and idiosyncratic guide to the sport they—and we—love. Published on the eve of the 2018 World Cup, this will be the book every soccer fan will need to have.</description><authors><author><id>140959</id><name>Roger Bennett</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='true'><![CDATA[https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='true'><![CDATA[https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/140959.Roger_Bennett]]></link><average_rating>4.17</average_rating><ratings_count>812</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>141</text_reviews_count></author></authors><published>2018</published><work><id>58170748</id><uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.i1MlwpZnB9Fgc07R2CkN_w</uri></work></book><rating>0</rating><votes>0</votes><spoiler_flag>false</spoiler_flag><spoilers_state>none</spoilers_state><shelves><shelf name="read" exclusive="true" id="207421735" review_shelf_id= ""/></shelves><recommended_for></recommended_for><recommended_by></recommended_by><started_at></started_at><read_at></read_at><date_added>Sun Jul 07 06:22:41 -0700 2019</date_added><date_updated>Sun Jul 07 06:22:42 -0700 2019</date_updated><read_count>1</read_count><body></body><comments_count>0</comments_count><url><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2886400700]]></url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2886400700]]></link><owned>0</owned></review><review><id>2508098530</id><book><id type="integer">579014</id><isbn>0830822577</isbn><isbn13>9780830822577</isbn13><text_reviews_count type="integer">321</text_reviews_count><uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.B6paKmLCC5Rlsjk1Tq6Lnw</uri><title>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction: Discipleship in an Instant Society</title><title_without_series>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction: Discipleship in an Instant Society</title_without_series><image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png</image_url><small_image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png</small_image_url><large_image_url/><link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/579014.A_Long_Obedience_in_the_Same_Direction</link><num_pages>212</num_pages><format>Paperback</format><edition_information/><publisher>IVP Books</publisher><publication_day>30</publication_day><publication_year>2000</publication_year><publication_month>6</publication_month><average_rating>4.25</average_rating><ratings_count>4895</ratings_count><description>As a society, we are no less obsessed with the immediate than when Eugene Peterson first wrote this Christian classic. If anything, email and the Internet may have intensified our quest for the quick fix. But Peterson's time-tested prescription for discipleship remains the same--a long obedience in the same direction. Tucked away in the Hebrew Psalter, Peterson discovered "an old dog-eared songbook," the Songs of Ascents that were sung by pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem. In these songs (Psalms 120-134) Peterson finds encouragement for modern pilgrims as we learn to grow in worship, service, joy, work, happiness, humility, community and blessing. This 20th anniversary edition of &lt;em&gt;A Long Obedience in the Same Direction&lt;/em&gt; features these Psalms in Peterson's widely acclaimed paraphrase, &lt;em&gt;The Message.&lt;/em&gt; He also includes an epilogue in which he reflects on the themes of this book and his ministry during the twenty years since its original publication.</description><authors><author><id>27926</id><name>Eugene H.

But God can become present to us in surprising ways through our everyday routines. Framed around one ordinary day, this book explores daily life through the lens of liturgy, small practices and habits that form us. Each chapter looks at something making the bed, brushing her teeth, losing her keys that the author does in the day. Drawing from the diversity of her life as a campus minister, Anglican priest, friend, wife, and mother, Tish Harrison Warren opens up a practical theology of the everyday. Each activity is related to a spiritual practice as well as an aspect of our Sunday worship. Come and discover the holiness of your every day."</description><authors><author><id>15180566</id><name>Tish Harrison Warren</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479599934p5/15180566.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479599934p2/15180566.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15180566.Tish_Harrison_Warren]]></link><average_rating>4.37</average_rating><ratings_count>4116</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>701</text_reviews_count></author></authors><published>2016</published><work><id>50285449</id><uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6T0MRDD-om0jQHkfPgbtUA</uri></work></book><rating>0</rating><votes>0</votes><spoiler_flag>false</spoiler_flag><spoilers_state>none</spoilers_state><shelves><shelf name="read" exclusive="true" id="207421735" review_shelf_id= ""/></shelves><recommended_for></recommended_for><recommended_by></recommended_by><started_at>Sat Jul 06 10:47:06 -0700 2019</started_at><read_at>Sat Jul 06 12:00:01 -0700 2019</read_at><date_added>Sat Jul 06 10:47:05 -0700 2019</date_added><date_updated>Sat Jul 06 12:00:01 -0700 2019</date_updated><read_count>1</read_count><body></body><comments_count>0</comments_count><url><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2885388291]]></url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2885388291]]></link><owned>0</owned></review><review><id>2883360884</id><book><id type="integer">35873286</id><isbn>1633198758</isbn><isbn13>9781633198753</isbn13><text_reviews_count type="integer">0</text_reviews_count><uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.HR_yf47myx9LkUm3ZuVRxQ</uri><title>100 Things Washington Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die</title><title_without_series>100 Things Washington Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die</title_without_series><image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502147620l/35873286._SX98_.jpg</image_url><small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502147620l/35873286._SY75_.jpg</small_image_url><large_image_url/><link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35873286-100-things-washington-fans-should-know-do-before-they-die</link><num_pages>256</num_pages><format>ebook</format><edition_information/><publisher>Triumph Books (IL)</publisher><publication_day>1</publication_day><publication_year>2017</publication_year><publication_month>9</publication_month><average_rating>4.25</average_rating><ratings_count>4</ratings_count><description>Most University of Washington fans have taken in a game or two at Husky Stadium or Hec Edmundson Pavilion.

Now, they build on their message with a bold, iconoclastic strategy for creating the ideal company culture—what they call "the calm company." Their approach directly attack the chaos, anxiety, and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and hampers billions of workers every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long hours, an excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for modern professionals. But it should be a mark of stupidity, the authors argue. Sadly, this isn’t just a problem for large organizations—individuals, contractors, and solopreneurs are burning themselves out the same way. The answer to better productivity isn’t more hours—it’s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction and persistent stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to stop celebrating Crazy, and start celebrating Calm, Fried and Hansson assert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. "Calm" has been the cornerstone of their company’s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, &lt;em&gt;It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/em&gt; is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn’t a book telling you what to do. It’s a book showing you what they’ve done—and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.</description><authors><author><id>60619</id><name>Jason Fried</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1284934282p5/60619.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1284934282p2/60619.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60619.Jason_Fried]]></link><average_rating>3.94</average_rating><ratings_count>137913</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>4904</text_reviews_count></author></authors><published>2018</published><work><id>60452039</id><uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mSJgaaM9hQg9VGaPAe12Pg</uri></work></book><rating>5</rating><votes>0</votes><spoiler_flag>false</spoiler_flag><spoilers_state>none</spoilers_state><shelves><shelf name="read" exclusive="true" id="207421735" review_shelf_id= ""/></shelves><recommended_for></recommended_for><recommended_by></recommended_by><started_at></started_at><read_at></read_at><date_added>Sun Nov 25 09:33:47 -0800 2018</date_added><date_updated>Sun Mar 31 07:27:23 -0700 2019</date_updated><read_count>1</read_count><body></body><comments_count>0</comments_count><url><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2605350613]]></url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2605350613]]></link><owned>0</owned></review><review><id>2766109156</id><book><id type="integer">7445</id><isbn>074324754X</isbn><isbn13>9780743247542</isbn13><text_reviews_count type="integer">44869</text_reviews_count><uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.CSqY36Erv2Ucd6VVUMIYQw</uri><title>The Glass Castle</title><title_without_series>The Glass Castle</title_without_series><image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SX98_.jpg</image_url><small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SY75_.jpg</small_image_url><large_image_url/><link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle</link><num_pages>288</num_pages><format>Paperback</format><edition_information/><publisher>Scribner</publisher><publication_day>17</publication_day><publication_year>2006</publication_year><publication_month>1</publication_month><average_rating>4.26</average_rating><ratings_count>790672</ratings_count><description>A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.</description><authors><author><id>3275</id><name>Jeannette Walls</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188356528p5/3275.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188356528p2/3275.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3275.Jeannette_Walls]]></link><average_rating>4.20</average_rating><ratings_count>978558</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>65513</text_reviews_count></author></authors><published>2006</published><work><id>2944133</id><uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.5DIRYwlGs0OElP62STWC8g</uri></work></book><rating>5</rating><votes>0</votes><spoiler_flag>false</spoiler_flag><spoilers_state>none</spoilers_state><shelves><shelf name="read" exclusive="true" id="207421735" review_shelf_id= ""/></shelves><recommended_for></recommended_for><recommended_by></recommended_by><started_at></started_at><read_at>Wed Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2019</read_at><date_added>Wed Mar 27 20:29:38 -0700 2019</date_added><date_updated>Tue Apr 30 13:27:24 -0700 2019</date_updated><read_count>1</read_count><body></body><comments_count>0</comments_count><url><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2766109156]]></url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2766109156]]></link><owned>0</owned></review><review><id>2566646576</id><book><id type="integer">11588</id><isbn>0450040186</isbn><isbn13>9780450040184</isbn13><text_reviews_count type="integer">13567</text_reviews_count><uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cJ_qKnsjt-poX9xhETHnjA</uri><title>The Shining (The Shining, #1)</title><title_without_series>The Shining</title_without_series><image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353277730l/11588._SX98_.jpg</image_url><small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353277730l/11588._SY75_.jpg</small_image_url><large_image_url/><link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining</link><num_pages>447</num_pages><format>Paperback</format><edition_information/><publisher>New English Library (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) </publisher><publication_day>1</publication_day><publication_year>1980</publication_year><publication_month>7</publication_month><average_rating>4.21</average_rating><ratings_count>972589</ratings_count><description>Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</description><authors><author><id>3389</id><name>Stephen King</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King]]></link><average_rating>4.03</average_rating><ratings_count>12606576</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>470132</text_reviews_count></author></authors><published>1980</published><work><id>849585</id><uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.pKw7WckTmBC38n38GZJVKQ</uri></work></book><rating>4</rating><votes>0</votes><spoiler_flag>false</spoiler_flag><spoilers_state>none</spoilers_state><shelves><shelf name="read" exclusive="true" id="207421735" review_shelf_id= ""/></shelves><recommended_for></recommended_for><recommended_by></recommended_by><started_at>Wed Feb 27 17:46:15 -0800 2019</started_at><read_at>Tue Mar 12 15:46:18 -0700 2019</read_at><date_added>Thu Oct 18 22:22:17 -0700 2018</date_added><date_updated>Tue Mar 12 15:46:18 -0700 2019</date_updated><read_count>1</read_count><body></body><comments_count>0</comments_count><url><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2566646576]]></url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2566646576]]></link><owned>0</owned></review><review><id>2659553999</id><book><id type="integer">26031172</id><isbn>1452148988</isbn><isbn13>9781452148984</isbn13><text_reviews_count type="integer">18</text_reviews_count><uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.fg58CyCxUyeOqeDyWWrg_g</uri><title>See America: A Celebration of Our National Parks &amp; Treasured Sites</title><title_without_series>See America: A Celebration of Our National Parks &amp; Treasured Sites</title_without_series><image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474857567l/26031172._SX98_.jpg</image_url><small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474857567l/26031172._SX50_.jpg</small_image_url><large_image_url/><link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26031172-see-america</link><num_pages>192</num_pages><format>Hardcover</format><edition_information/><publisher>Chronicle Books</publisher><publication_day>22</publication_day><publication_year>2016</publication_year><publication_month>3</publication_month><average_rating>4.08</average_rating><ratings_count>114</ratings_count><description>To coincide with the 2016 centennial anniversary of the National Parks Service, the Creative Action Network has partnered with the National Parks Conservation Association to revive and reimagine the legacy of WPA travel posters.
